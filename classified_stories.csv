"As I scrolled through relationship advice threads on Reddit, I couldn't help but notice a recurring trend that bothered me. Many commenters seem too quick to suggest ending relationships at the first sign of trouble. It got me thinking about the importance of facing challenges in relationships to foster emotional growth. Instead of advocating for easy exits, shouldn't we be encouraging deeper communication, empathy, and understanding as the initial response to conflicts? I believe that overcoming obstacles with our partners strengthens our emotional intelligence and helps us evolve into more mature individuals. What are your thoughts on this approach to handling relationship issues?",good
"TITLE: Are We Losing Sight of Real-Life Morality on Social Media?

CONTENT: 
Hey everyone, I've been noticing a concerning trend lately both online and offline. It seems like the values portrayed on social media platforms like Reddit are starting to diverge from what we consider moral behavior in real life. Take, for example, the recent incidents of people being judged harshly for minor actions or disagreements, leading to a mob mentality of downvoting and criticism.

In a world where online interactions increasingly shape our perceptions of right and wrong, are we at risk of losing touch with the nuances of human behavior? Should we be more mindful of how our online judgments align with real-world morality? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this growing disconnect between digital ethics and everyday values.",good
"TITLE: The Danger of Misjudging Strangers

I wanted to share a chilling experience that happened to me recently. Late one night, after returning home from a New Year's Eve party, I was startled by persistent doorbell ringing. Initially dismissing it as a prank, I eventually answered the intercom to a stranger claiming to need access to the building. Despite feeling uneasy, a convincing plea from a woman outside almost convinced me to let them in. In a moment of clarity, I decided to check from my balcony and discovered a group of suspicious individuals plotting at the gate. It dawned on me that I narrowly avoided a potential trap. This incident made me realize the importance of trusting instincts and being cautious around strangers, especially in vulnerable situations. What are your thoughts on this kind of situation?",bad

Hey everyone, I wanted to share my story about a recent relationship revelation. After reading through some Reddit posts about relationship dynamics, I realized that I had been ignoring some red flags in my own relationship. Like many others, I found myself making excuses for my partner's behaviors and not setting boundaries early on. It wasn't until a heated argument escalated into a violent outburst that I finally saw the reality of the situation. 

Looking back, I wish I had paid more attention to the early warning signs and addressed them sooner. It's crucial to listen to your instincts and not dismiss any feelings of discomfort or unease. I urge everyone to reflect on their own relationships and not hesitate to seek help or support if needed. Have you ever experienced similar situations?

CONTENT: Recently, I've been pondering the idea of perfection in relationships. Are we truly seeking perfection, or are we merely chasing an illusion?
